    <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This article covers how investigators used genealogy websites to identify the Golden State Killer. By analyzing partial DNA matches and family trees, police tracked the suspect through relativesâ€™ DNA. The case shows how new technology and public DNA databases can solve decades-old crimes, even without direct evidence. It raises questions about privacy and ethics but proves the power of DNA in modern investigations.</td></tr>
